The concept of the first semester's project was to code something that will showcase one of the SDGs; therefore, the main protagonist, who is supposed to be an alien, crashed on Earth that needs to do some cleaning chores in order to gain a few parts for his spaceship, to repair it, and be able to go home. As the only developer on the team, I took the opportunity to turn it into a two-dimensional game whilst keeping the style of a console-typo game.
Since this was the first-time coding graphics at this level, implementing the breadth first search algorithm might have been the hardest part of adhering to the agile and OOP practices. Nevertheless, it was undoubtedly a major learning experience, leading one to believe that they will never be brave enough to attempt three-dimensional graphics.
The robot that followed the protagonist was intended to be an NPC that assisted and explained the general gameplay, but because of the approaching deadline and the lack of isometric tiles, the game has never been able to realise its full potential.
